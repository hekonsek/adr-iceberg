# Adopt Apache Iceberg REST Catalog for all Iceberg table deployments

## Context

Usual Iceberg table deployments use a mix of catalog mechanisms (HadoopCatalog, Hive Metastore, Glue). While these solutions work, they exhibit several limitations:
- Tight coupling to specific compute engines (e.g., Spark ↔ Hive).
- Limited interoperability between engines (Spark, Flink, Trino, Dremio).
- Difficult authentication and authorization management, especially in multi-cloud or multi-tenant setups.
- Operational friction — separate catalog backends per project, inconsistent namespace handling.
- Vendor-specific APIs, leading to lock-in or re-implementation effort when migrating.
- It is also difficult to query such catalogs using standalone clients.

The Iceberg REST Catalog specification (part of Apache Iceberg 1.3+) introduces a standardized, HTTP-based API for all catalog operations (create, list, load, commit). This model decouples client configuration from metadata storage and enables a clean separation of concerns.

## Decision

- We will adopt the Iceberg REST Catalog as the default catalog interface for all new and migrated Iceberg tables.
- All compute engines (Spark, Flink, Trino, Dremio, etc.) will connect via the REST Catalog API.
- The REST endpoint will abstract away the backend metadata store (PostgreSQL, Glue, etc.).

## Consequences

✅ Positive
- Full multi-engine interoperability: any Iceberg-compliant client can access tables through REST.
- Centralized governance: unified namespace and auth model across teams.
- Cloud-agnostic: same API works on GCP, AWS, or on-prem.
- Future-proof: aligns with Iceberg’s official specification direction.
- Simplified client config: engines point to a single HTTP endpoint instead of DB or Hive URIs.
- Decoupled lifecycle: catalog server can evolve independently from storage or compute.

⚠️ Negative
- Requires operating a catalog service (extra deployment component).
- Latency overhead (minor HTTP call vs local Hive Metastore).
- Migration effort from legacy catalogs.
- Security and SLA responsibility moves to us (until managed offerings mature).

## Options Considered
- Hadoop Catalog: Filesystem-based metadata. Simple, no service. No multi-engine consistency, limited auth.
- Hive Metastore: HMS catalog. Familiar, mature. Tight coupling, Kerberos, legacy stack.
- Glue Catalog: AWS managed	Easy for AWS. AWS-only, limited interop.
- REST Catalog (chosen): Iceberg REST spec. Open, extensible, secure. New operational component.
